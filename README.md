# adventOfCode2020
Advent of code 2020 solution attempts as an excuse to learn/practice APL (Dyalog APL to be precise).

## Learning APL
If you are interested in APL see the first chapter of Mastering Dyalog APL for a good overview of the language: https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm

I would also reccomend the APL blog posts from Dr. Aaron Hsu: https://www.sacrideo.us/tag/apl/

A history of APL in 50 functions: https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/

To see someone solve problems in APL live, this talk from Aaron is also very informative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsj_7tFtODk&ab_channel=ConfEngine

Finally in terms of community there are two main places to go:
- The APL (and J and K languages) subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/apljk
- The APL Orchard chat room: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52405/the-apl-orchard
